    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is the most popular of all chicken breast recipes that I’ve ever published. It’s a JUICY Oven Baked Chicken Breast sprinkled with a magic simple seasoning, baked until caramelised. It’s simple, fast and incredibly tasty! This is a reader-favourite alongside Honey Garlic Chicken, this epic Parmesan Crusted Chicken and crispy Garlic Chicken.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>4 chicken breasts</li>
        <li>2 tsp olive oil</li>
        <li>etc.</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425°F/220°C (200°C fan).</li>
        <li>Pound chicken to 1.5cm / 0.6″ at the thickest part – using a rolling pin, meat mallet or even your fist (key tip for even cooking + tender chicken).</li>
        <li>Mix Seasoning.</li>
        <li>Line tray with foil and baking / parchment paper. Place chicken upside down on tray. Drizzle chicken with about 1 tsp oil. Rub over with fingers. Sprinkle with Seasoning.</li>
        <li>Flip chicken. Drizzle with 1 tsp oil, rub with fingers, sprinkle with Seasoning, covering as much of the surface area as you can.</li>
        <li>Bake 18 minutes, or until surface is golden per photos and video, or internal temperature is 165°F/75°C using a meat thermometer.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and immediately transfer chicken to serving plates.</li>
        <li>Wait 3 – 5 minutes before serving, garnished with freshly chopped parsley if desired. Pictured with a side of Garlic Butter Rice with Kale.</li>
        </ol>
